# Trash-Bin
This is a repo for containting codes that I practiced and coded when I was too young too simple:)

Codes in this repo will not be maintained unless I utilize it in other project. If I use codes in this repo in somewhere else, I will fork another version in that project and maintain code in that projet.

I will place a README in each dir of these old codes.
